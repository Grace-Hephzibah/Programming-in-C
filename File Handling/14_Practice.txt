Spring season comes between winter and summer.
Its beginning marks the end of harsh winter and its end marks the beginning of summer.
Though this season is short lived, it is called the king of all seasons.
Spring is the season of rebirth and rejuvenation of nature.
It awakens nature from deep slumber and nature becomes active again and brings a new life to Earth.
